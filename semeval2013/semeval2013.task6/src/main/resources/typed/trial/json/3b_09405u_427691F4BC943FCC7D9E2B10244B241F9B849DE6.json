This new Church was built by the generosity of Francis Wright Esquire, of Lenton Hall, Derby Road, Lenton (now part of the Nottingham University campus). Towards the total cost of £6,000 he donated £3,000, besides giving the land for the Church site, the schools and master's and mistresses houses (opposite the Church), and a vicarage. At the time the Church was built, Church Street ran adjacent to the Church yard, over the level-crossing of the Midland Railway line, the present railway bridge not having been built until around 1890. The first stone was officially laid by Francis Wright Esquire (donor) on 11th June 1841, while the completed Church was consecrated on 6th October 1842 at 11 a.m. by the Lord Bishop of Lincoln (the Right Reverend John Jackson D.D.). The Reverend George Browne M.A., who had been in the parish for a year as curate, became the first vicar of the new Lenton Parish Church. The style of the Church is early English and it is 123 feet long, 57 feet wide, and seats 660. It is a stone building, with a high pitched roof, and consists of nave, with clerestory, north and south aisles, chancel, vestry, organ-chamber, and lofty square pinnacled tower at the west end having a clock with four dials. The first clock was installed in 1844 but has been replaced with one electrically operated."]},"dcFormat":{"def":["JPEG/IMAGE"]},"dcIdentifier":{"def":["http://www.picturethepast.org.uk/frontend.php?keywords=Ref_No_increment;EQUALS;NTGM009407&pos=2&action=zoom"]},"dcLanguage":{"def":["EN-GB"]},"dcPublisher":{"def":["North East Midland Photographic Record"]},"dcSubject":{"def":["select","Please"]},"dcTitle":{"def":["Holy Trinity Church, Church Street, Lenton, Nottingham, 1931"]},"dcType":{"def":["Image"]},"dctermsIsPartOf":{"def":["Picture the Past"]},"proxyIn":["/aggregation/provider/2022323/427691F4BC943FCC7D9E2B10244B241F9B849DE6"],"proxyFor":"/item/2022323/427691F4BC943FCC7D9E2B10244B241F9B849DE6","edmType":"IMAGE","europeanaProxy":false},{"about":"/proxy/europeana/2022323/427691F4BC943FCC7D9E2B10244B241F9B849DE6","proxyIn":["/aggregation/europeana/2022323/427691F4BC943FCC7D9E2B10244B241F9B849DE6"],"proxyFor":"/item/2022323/427691F4BC943FCC7D9E2B10244B241F9B849DE6","europeanaProxy":true}],"aggregations":[{"about":"/aggregation/provider/2022323/427691F4BC943FCC7D9E2B10244B241F9B849DE6","edmDataProvider":{"def":["Picture the Past OAI feed"]},"edmIsShownAt":"http://www.picturethepast.org.uk/frontend.php?keywords=Ref_No_increment;EQUALS;NTGM009407&pos=2&action=zoom&bt=europeanaapi","edmObject":"http://www.culturegrid.org.uk/dpp/resource/2241756/stream/thumbnail_image_jpeg","edmProvider":{"def":["CultureGrid"]},"edmRights":{"def":["http://www.europeana.eu/rights/rr-f/"]},"webResources":[{"about":"http://www.picturethepast.org.uk/frontend.php?keywords=Ref_No_increment;EQUALS;NTGM009407&pos=2&action=zoom"},{"about":"http://www.culturegrid.org.uk/dpp/resource/2241756/stream/thumbnail_image_jpeg"}]}],"europeanaCompleteness":10,"providedCHOs":[{"about":"/item/2022323/427691F4BC943FCC7D9E2B10244B241F9B849DE6"}],"europeanaAggregation":{"about":"/aggregation/europeana/2022323/427691F4BC943FCC7D9E2B10244B241F9B849DE6","edmLandingPage":"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2022323/427691F4BC943FCC7D9E2B10244B241F9B849DE6","edmCountry":{"def":["united kingdom"]},"edmLanguage":{"def":["en"]}},"europeanaCollectionName":["09405u_Ag_UK_ELocal_PicturethePast"]}}
