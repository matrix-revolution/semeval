Queensferry is located on the southern banks of the Forth and it as at this point that the estuary is at its narrowest. Blackness Castle stands on a promontory jutting into the Forth and was built in the 15th century by Sir George Crichton to protect the port of Linlithgow. Garvie Island is one of many islands rising in the Forth. The Grampian Mountain can be seen in the background of this print, rising to a height of 1309 meters.
